It's been a tough decision, but we've decided to shut down Impact Dialing. Over the years, we've built a dialer that's incredibly easy to use, powerful, scalable, and affordable. We haven't been able to build our business in a sustainable way, though, never having established a customer base outside of the political market, and failing to make enough inroads into the political market to financially withstand the dramatic election-season swings.

We're proud of what we've accomplished, but we're a very small company and, as the founder, I'm ready to move on. Without a sustainable revenue base, we couldn't have an established staff, and without an established staff, I couldn't shift my attention elsewhere. We decided to quit while we were ahead, and closed our doors at the end of 2016.

In this Github organization, we've open sourced the software we've built on the the GNU GPL3 license for anybody who wants to continue using and/or developing it.
